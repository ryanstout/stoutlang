## Overview

## What Makes StoutLang Special

Before we dive in, lets talk about why you might want to use StoutLang. StoutLang combines the best of Rust, Zig, and innovative functional languages like Koka. StoutLang is designed to let the compiler do more work than what you're used to. (Aka, you get things for free)

- **Free Performance!** 🚀 - A novel effect type system and AI based machine code optimizer that can run easy to read/write code faster than hand optimized C. (I know, a bold claim)

- **Free Maintainability!** 🛠️ - The effect type system gives you most of the code guarantees that might draw you to a pure functional programming language, but the code is much simpler and easier to understand.

- **Free Portability!** 🌍 - StoutLang can generate fast code for any hardware platform supported by the LLVM or WebAssembly. It has first-class WebAssembly support. (meaning it can run in the browser, on edge, in a WebAssembly sandbox instead of needing a container, etc...) Cross compilation is as easy as specifying --target=, everything is statically linked, your binary just runs on any hardware, no dependency installs needed.

- **Free (ok, just easy?) Deployment!** 📦 - All code is statically linked, meaning you can easily produce binaries for any platform with a single command. Those binaries run out of the box without installing any dependencies.

- **Free Parallelism!** ⚡ - StoutLang can automatically parallelize code and run it in a deterministic way. (Free multi-core!)

- **Free Happiness!** 😊 - StoutLang is easy to learn, it builds on a few simple concepts to deliver what your current language isn't. When the language does more of the work, you can focus on writing more on just building the things your project needs.

- **Free Batteries!** 🔋 - The standard library tries to do a lot and do it well. You can't build a great building without a strong foundation.
